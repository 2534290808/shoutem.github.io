# Publishing your extension!

<hr />
Once your extension is done, you can publish it. Although your extension is already uploaded and installed to application, that application can't be published until extension is publish.

By default, all extension that you publish to the market are only visible to you. So, let's publish it!

```
shoutem publish
```

[//]: <> (TODO - picture which shows the published extension)

However, you might want to make your extension public and available for others to use. You can even make [money](TODO) writing extensions. See chapter about [Developer console](TODO) to check for all possibilities with your extensions.
