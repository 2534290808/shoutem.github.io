# Shoutem CLI
Shoutem Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that helps you build extensions. Using it, you can create extensions, generate code snippets, upload extensions to your Shoutem account and install them on your applications.

## Installation
Download and install Shoutem CLI through `npm`, the package manager for `Node.js`.

```ShellSession
$ npm install -g @shoutem/cli
```

In case you don't have `npm` installed, the best way to install it is with [installing](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `Node.js`, which includes `npm`.

## Commands

Here is the list of available commands.

- ##### shoutem

Lists all the commands.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem
```

- ##### shoutem [--version|-V]

Prints CLI version.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem -V
1.0.0
```

- ##### shoutem help \<cmd>

Prints help for command.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem help init

Usage: shoutem init <extension name>

Create a scaffold of all files and folders required to build an extension.

Options:

-h, --help  output usage information
```

- ##### shoutem login

Authenticates you as developer. Enter your Shoutem credentials. If you're not a Shoutem user yet, sign up at [www.shoutem.com](https://www.shoutem.com).

```ShellSession
$ shoutem login
Enter your Shoutem credentials:
E-mail: developer@example.com
Password: ********
```

Each Shoutem user can become Shoutem developer. If you still are not a developer, after you entered correct credentials, you'll be prompted a new developer name.

```ShellSession
Enter a new developer name:
Name: david
You are registered as `david`!
```

- ##### shoutem whoami

Prints developer name of currently authenticated user.

```ShellSession
Authenticated as `david`.
```

- ##### shoutem logout

Logs you out from CLI.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem logout
Successfully logged out.
```

- ##### shoutem init \<extension-name>

Initializes extension project.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem init example
Enter information about your extension. Press `return` to accept (default) values.
Title: Restaurants
Version: 0.0.1
Description: List of restaurants
Extension initialized!
```

After initialization, your extension folder structure will look as follows:

```
Restaurants/
  ├ app/
  |  ├ node_modules/
  |  |  └ ...
  |  ├ const.js
  |  ├ index.js
  |  └ package.json
  ├ server/
  |  ├ node_modules/
  |  |  └ ...
  |  ├ index.js
  |  └ package.json
  └ extension.json
```

- ##### shoutem push

Pushes extension to Shoutem server.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem push
Uploading `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Success!
```

As long as extension is not published, every `push` will overwrite current development version of extension. Once you `publish` extension, that version of extension will be unchangeable and you will be able to `push` only higher version numbers.

- ##### shoutem publish

Publishes extension to Shoutem server.

```ShelSession
$ shoutem publish
Publishing `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Version 0.0.1 is successfully published!
```

- ##### shoutem install [--new|--app-id=\<app-id>]

Installs extension to the app. If no flags or arguments are passed, CLI will offer interactive menu.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem install
Select app to install your extension:
> RestaurantsApp
  --------------
  Create a new app
```

Pass a flag `--new` to install it on a new app or install it on specific app with `--app-id=\<app-id>`.
