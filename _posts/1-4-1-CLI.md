# Shoutem CLI
Shoutem Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that helps you build extensions. Using it, you can create extensions, generate code snippets, upload extensions to your Shoutem account and install them on your applications.

## Installation
Download and install Shoutem CLI through `npm`, the package manager for `Node.js`.

```ShellSession
$ npm install -g @shoutem/cli
```

In case you don't have `npm` installed, the best way to install it is with [installing](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `Node.js`, which includes `npm`.

## Commands

Here is the list of available commands.

- ##### shoutem

Lists all the commands.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem
Usage: shoutem [command] [-h]

Commands:
...
```

- ##### shoutem [--version|-v]

Prints out the CLI version.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem -v
1.0.0
```

- ##### shoutem \<cmd> -h

Prints help for command.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem init -h

Usage: shoutem init <extension-name>

Create a scaffold of all files and folders required to build an extension.
```

- ##### shoutem login

Authenticates you as developer. Enter your Shoutem credentials. If you're not a Shoutem user yet, sign up at [www.shoutem.com](https://www.shoutem.com).

```ShellSession
$ shoutem login
Enter your Shoutem credentials:
E-mail: developer@example.com
Password: ********
```

Each Shoutem user can become Shoutem developer. If you still are not a developer, after you entered correct credentials, you'll be prompted a new developer name.

```ShellSession
Enter new developer name:
Name: david
You are registered as `david`!
```

- ##### shoutem whoami

Prints developer name of currently authenticated user.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem whoami
Authenticated as `david`.
```

- ##### shoutem logout

Logs you out from CLI.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem logout
Successfully logged out.
```

- ##### shoutem init \<extension-name>

Initializes extension project.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem init example
Enter information about your extension. Press `return` to accept (default) values.

Title: Restaurants
Version: 0.0.1
Description: List of restaurants

Extension initialized!
```

After initialization, your extension folder structure will look as follows:

```
Restaurants/
  ├ app/
  |  ├ node_modules/
  |  |  └ ...
  |  ├ const.js
  |  ├ index.js
  |  └ package.json
  ├ server/
  |  ├ node_modules/
  |  |  └ ...
  |  ├ index.js
  |  └ package.json
  └ extension.json
```

- ##### shoutem push

Pushes extension to Shoutem server.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem push
Uploading `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Success!
```

As long as extension is not published, every `push` will overwrite current development version of extension. Once you `publish` extension, that version of extension will be unchangeable and you will be able to `push` only higher version numbers.

- ##### shoutem publish

Publishes extension to Shoutem server.

```ShelSession
$ shoutem publish
Publishing `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Version `0.0.1` is successfully published!
```

- ##### shoutem install [--new|--app=\<app-id>]

Installs extension to the app. If no flags or arguments are passed, CLI will offer interactive menu.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem install
Select app to install your extension:
> RestaurantsApp
  --------------
  Create a new app
```

Pass a flag `--new` to install it on a new app.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem install --new
Installing `Restaurnats` extension to the new app...
Extension successfully installed to the new app. Check it here:
https://builder.shoutem.com/app/5128
```

Also, you can install it on specific app by providing app id, found in app settings:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem install --app=5127
Installing `Restaurnats` extension to `Restaurants` app...
Extension successfully installed to the app. Check it here:
https://builder.shoutem.com/app/5127
```

Installation can be done through builder as well.

Enter shortcut information:
Title: (RestaurantsList)
Description:

File `extension.json` was modified.
```

Pass `--screen` option with screen name as value, to create a screen and connect it with new shortcut in `extension.json`.

```
