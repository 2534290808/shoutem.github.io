# Shoutem CLI
Shoutem Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that helps you build extensions. Using it, you can create extensions, generate code snippets, upload extensions to your Shoutem account and install them on your applications.

## Installation
Download and install Shoutem CLI through `npm`, the package manager for `Node.js`.

```ShellSession
$ npm install -g @shoutem/cli
```

In case you don't have `npm` installed, the best way to install it is with [installing](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `Node.js`, which includes `npm`.

## Commands

Here is the list of available commands.

- ##### shoutem

Lists all the commands.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem
Usage: shoutem [command] [-h]

Commands:
...
```

- ##### shoutem [\--version|-v]

Prints out the CLI version.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem -v

```ShellSession
$ shoutem init -h

Usage: shoutem init <extension-name>

```

- ##### shoutem login

Authenticates you as developer. Enter your Shoutem credentials. If you're not a Shoutem user yet, sign up at [www.shoutem.com](https://www.shoutem.com).

```ShellSession
$ shoutem login
Enter your Shoutem credentials:
E-mail: developer@example.com

```

Each Shoutem user can become Shoutem developer. If you still are not a developer, after you entered correct credentials, you'll be prompted a new developer name.

```ShellSession

Name: david
You are registered as `david`!
```

- ##### shoutem logout

Logs you out from CLI.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem logout

```

- ##### shoutem init \<extension-name>

Initializes extension project.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem init example
Enter information about your extension. Press `return` to accept (default) values.

Title: Restaurants
Version: 0.0.1
Description: List of restaurants

Extension initialized!
```

After initialization, your extension folder structure will look as follows:

```
Restaurants/
  ├ app/
  |  ├ node_modules/
  |  |  └ ...
  |  ├ const.js
  |  ├ index.js
  |  └ package.json
  ├ server/
  |  ├ node_modules/
  |  |  └ ...

```

Run this command from extension folder.

- ##### shoutem push

Pushes extension to Shoutem server.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem push

Pass a flag `--new` to install it on a new app.

```ShellSession
