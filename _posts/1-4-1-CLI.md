# Shoutem CLI
Shoutem Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool to manage your extensions. By using it you can create extensions, generate code stubs, upload extensions to your Shoutem account and install them on your applications. Here you can find a list of available commands. 


### Install
You can download and install Shoutem CLI through `npm`, the package management system for `Node.js`.

```ShellSession
$ npm install -g @shoutem/cli
```

In case you don't have `npm` installed, the best way to install it is with [installing](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `Node.js`, which includes `npm`.

### Register
Enter your Shoutem credentials, and register as a developer. If you're not a Shoutem user yet,
sign up at [www.shoutem.com](https://www.shoutem.com).

```ShellSession
$ shoutem register
Enter your Shoutem credentials.
Email: developer@example.com
Password:

Please enter a new developer name
name Johnny
You are registered as "Johnny"
```

### Init
This command will initialize your extension by generating extension's project folder structure and by creating necessary files with initial code stubs.

```Shellsession
$ shoutem init
This utility will walk you through creating the extension.json file
name (test) hello
version (0.0.1)
title (test)
description Hello, extensions!
Extension initialized
```

Layout after running `shoutem init`:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── index.js
│   └── package.json
├── extension.json
└── server
```

### Push
Push the extension to Shoutem server so it can be installed to applications.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem push
Uploading `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Success!
```

As long as version in `extension.json` is unchanged, every upload will simply
overwrite the current content of the extension. Once you bump up the version,
`shoutem upload` will not affect the already uploaded extension - instead, a new
extension will be created which can be installed independently from previous
versions.

### Install
Install extension into an app. If `extension` flag is not used, local extension
will be installed.

Install local extension:
```Shellsession
$ shoutem install --app=1234
Extension installed
```

Install any extension by id:
```Shellsession
$ shoutem install --app=1234 --extension=5678
Extension installed
```

### Create Shortcut
Create Shortuct command is a helper command that adds a shortcut code into `extension.json`.

```Shellsession
$ shoutem create shortcut OpenRestaurantsList
Enter shortcut's informations.
Title: List of restaurants
Description: Allow users to browse through list of restaurants
`OpenRestaurantsList` shortcut is created.
```

### Create Screen
Create Screen command is a helper command that creates a screen and fills it with a necessary code stub. 

```Shellsession
$ shoutem create screen RestaurantsList
`RestaurantsList` screen is created.
```


### Create Schema
Create Schema command is a helper command that creates a Shoutem-flavored JSON Schemas fills it with some initial data. 

```Shellsession
$ shoutem create data-schema Restaurants
`Restaurants` data schema is created.
Success!
```

### Logout
Logout from Shoutem by erasing local credentials. After this, commands will
ask you to login before continuing.

##### Example
```Shellsession
$ shoutem logout
You've been logged out
```
