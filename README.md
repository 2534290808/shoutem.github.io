# Shoutem

Shoutem is a platform for building beautiful React Native mobile apps. The easiest way to understand how Shoutem is used is to think of it as a Wordpress for mobile apps. Shoutem plugins are called Extensions. Entire apps are build out of extensions. 


## Marketplace

Shoutem has already prepared number of fully functional extensions to kick off your app development. You can use extensions like User Authentication that contains all screens like login, register etc. session handling logic and integration with various auth providers. Just install it in your app and use it. 
You can find a full list of extension [here](https://github.com/shoutem/extensions). 


## Customization

Everything is open sourced. You can checkout Shoutem’s extensions and make modifications on them, or you can write your own from the scratch. Whatever fits your needs. 

To make developer’s life easier, we’ve prepared number of tools and libraries like [Shoutem CLI](http://shoutem.github.io/docs/extensions/reference/cli), [Shoutem UI toolkit](https://shoutem.github.io/ui/) and even this developer’s [documentation](http://shoutem.github.io/). 


## React Native

Shoutem app is a React Native app. We designed extensions’ architecture with the goal not to add overhead over pure React Native. If you know React Native, you will know how to write Shoutem extensions.
