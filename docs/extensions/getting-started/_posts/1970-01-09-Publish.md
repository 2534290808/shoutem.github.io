# Publish your extension!
<hr />

Once your extension is ready, you can publish it. Application can't be published until every extension in that app is published. At the moment, every extension that you publish to the market is only visible to you.

So, let's publish it!

```ShellSession
$ shoutem publish
Publishing `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Version `0.0.1` of `Restaurants` extensions was published!
```

Once you're satisfied with your app, you can go to `Settings` tab to update iOS and Android store metadata and publish your app!

Shoutem has developed very easy and intuitive process of app publishing, once your app is ready. Simply insert information on one place and Shoutem will do the rest.

## What's next?
