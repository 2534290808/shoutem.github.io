# Shoutem CLI
Shoutem Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that helps you build extensions. Using it, you can create extensions, generate code snippets, upload extensions to your Shoutem account and install them on your apps.

## Installation
Download and install Shoutem CLI through `npm`, the package manager for `Node.js`.

```ShellSession
$ npm install -g @shoutem/cli
```

If the previous command fails because of permission issues, you need to run it with `sudo` permission: `sudo npm install -g @shoutem/cli`.

<br />
In case you don't have `npm` installed, the best way to install it is with [installing](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `Node.js`, which includes `npm`.

## Commands

Here is the list of available commands. <br />

- ##### shoutem

Lists all the commands.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem
Usage: shoutem [command] [-h]

Commands:
...
```

- ##### shoutem [\--version|-v]

Prints out the CLI version.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem -v

```ShellSession
$ shoutem init -h

Usage: shoutem init <extension-name>

```

- ##### shoutem login

Authenticates you as developer. Enter your Shoutem credentials. If you're not a Shoutem user yet, sign up [here]({{ site.shoutem.builderURL }}).

```ShellSession
$ shoutem login
Enter your Shoutem credentials (obtained at {{ site.shoutem.builderURL }}):
E-mail: {{ site.example.devEmail }}
Password: ********
```

Each Shoutem user can become Shoutem developer. If you still are not a developer, after you entered correct credentials, you'll be prompted a new developer name.

```ShellSession
Enter new developer name:
Name: {{ site.example.devName }}
You are registered as `{{ site.example.devName }}`!
```

- ##### shoutem logout

Logs you out from CLI.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem logout
Successfully logged out.
```

- ##### shoutem init \<extension-name>

Initializes extension project.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem init example
Enter information about your extension. Press `return` to accept (default) values.

Title: Restaurants
Version: 0.0.1
Description: List of restaurants
...
Extension initialized!
```

After initialization, your extension folder structure will look as follows:

```
Restaurants/
  ├ app/
  |  ├ node_modules/
  |  |  └ ...
  |  ├ extension.js
  |  ├ index.js
  |  └ package.json
  ├ server/
  |  ├ node_modules/
  |  |  └ ...
  |  ├ index.js
  |  └ package.json
  └ extension.json
```

Run this command from extension folder.

- ##### shoutem push

Pushes extension to Shoutem server.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem push
Uploading `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Success!
```

As long as extension is not published, every `push` will overwrite current development version of extension. Once you `publish` extension, that version of extension will be unchangeable and you will be able to `push` only higher version numbers.

Run this command from extension folder.

- ##### shoutem publish

Publishes extension to Shoutem server.

```ShelSession
$ shoutem publish
Publishing `Restaurants` extension to Shoutem...
Version `0.0.1` is successfully published!
```

Run this command from extension folder.

- ##### shoutem install [\--new|\--app \<app-id>]

Installs extension to the app. If no flags or arguments are passed, CLI will offer interactive menu.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem install
Select app to install your extension:
> RestaurantsApp
  --------------
  Create a new app
```

Pass a flag `--new` to install it on a new app.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem install --new
Installing `Restaurnats` extension to the new app...
Extension successfully installed to the new app. Check it here:
{{ site.shoutem.builderURL }}/app/{{ site.example.appId }}
```

Also, you can install it on specific app by providing app id, found in app settings:

```ShellSession
$ shoutem install --app {{ site.example.appId }}
Installing `Restaurnats` extension to `Restaurants` app...
Extension successfully installed to the app. Check it here:
{{ site.shoutem.builderURL }}/app/{{ site.example.appId }}
```

Installation can be done through builder as well.

File `app/extension.js` was modified.

```ShellSession

Page `HelloPage` is created in `server/pages/HelloPage` folder.
File `extension.json` was modified.
```

Run this command from extension folder.

- ##### shoutem theme add \<theme-name>

Variables for the theme are created in file `server/themes/ArgoVariables.json`
File `extension.json` was modified.
```

- ##### shoutem link

Connects local extension to the app for local development (can be be also used for linking packages like UI toolkit).

```ShellSession
$ shoutem link
Extension successfully linked. Please, kill the packager before running the app.
```

- ##### shoutem unlink

```ShellSession
$ shoutem unlink
Unlink successful. Please, kill the packager before running the app.
```

- ##### shoutem show

```ShellSession
$ shoutem show

Linked extensions:
  `restaurants` - ~/{{ site.example.devName }}/extensions/restaurants
```

- ##### shoutem run [app-id] [--dev] [--local] [--small]

Executes packager locally to run and debug custom or existing extensions using Shoutem Preview app on both Android and iOS without having to setup Android Studio and/or XCode.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem run
...
Select your app: Restaurants ({{ site.example.appId }})
...
http://shoutem.app.link/?host=df4d8960.ngrok.io&port=80&dev=false
QR CODE
```

If `app-id` is ommited, list of all user's apps is displayed for selection.

You can scan the QR code containing the app url using Shoutem Preview app (available on both Google Play and App Store) or any QR code reader. Regular QR code reader should open or install Shoutem Preview app.

Upon reading the QR code, Shoutem Preview will connect to your computer and embed the JS code within itself. You can now see how your app behaves and feels on a real device without ever having to build or pull the native code.

`shoutem run --dev` If you want to debug your extensions using this method, you should 1) link them using `shoutem link` command and 2) use the `--dev` flag. This will incur a performance penalty but will allow you to connect with Chrome/Safari/Firefox debug tools.

`shoutem run --local` Avoid tunneling the react packager through ngrok (https://ngrok.com/) and allow Shoutem Preview app to fetch the JS bundle directly from your computer. This will reduce the delay in refreshing code changes but also requires your laptop to be on the same network as your phone. Also, your computer must be able to open 8081 port. This might require manual configuration of your computer's firewall settings.

`shoutem run --small` Creates a smaller QR code. Useful if you don't like resizing the terminal but has troubles rendering with some terminal fonts.

- ##### shoutem run-ios [app-id]

Runs application with `app-id` ID locally on the iOS simulator. Setup [iOS environment](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for React Native before.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem run-ios
Select a device: iPhone 6
Select your app: Restaurants ({{ site.example.appId }})
Running `Restaurants` app on `iPhone 6` simulator...
...
```

If `app-id` is ommited, list of all user's apps is displayed for selection.

- ##### shoutem run-android [app-id]

Runs application with `app-id` ID locally on the Android emulator. Setup [Android environment](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for React Native before.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem run-android
Select a device: TestDevice
Select your app: Restaurants ({{ site.example.appId }})
Running `Restaurants` app on `TestDevice` simulator...
...
```

If `app-id` is ommited, list of all user's apps is displayed for selection.

- ##### shoutem pack

Packs the extension. This command is used by `shoutem push` and with it, you can check how your extensions looks like when it's pushed to Shoutem servers.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem pack
Extension is packed at: ~/restaurants.tgz
```

- ##### shoutem whoami

Displays the username of current user.

```ShellSession
$ shoutem whoami
Signed in as `{{ site.example.devName }}`.
```

Find the extension packed in the root of the extension folder.
