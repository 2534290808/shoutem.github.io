# Shoutem CLI
Shoutem Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool that helps you build extensions. Using it, you can create extensions, generate code snippets, upload extensions to your Shoutem account and install them on your apps.

## Installation
Download and install Shoutem CLI through `npm`, the package manager for `Node.js`.

```ShellSession
$ npm install -g @shoutem/cli
```

If the previous command fails because of permission issues, you need to run it with `sudo` permission: `sudo npm install -g @shoutem/cli`.

<br />
In case you don't have `npm` installed, the best way to install it is with [installing](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `Node.js`, which includes `npm`.

## Commands

Here is the list of available commands. <br />

- ##### shoutem

```ShellSession

```ShellSession
$ shoutem login

Each Shoutem user can become Shoutem developer. If you still are not a developer, after you entered correct credentials, you'll be prompted a new developer name.

```

After initialization, your extension folder structure will look as follows:

```
Restaurants/
  ├ app/

  |  |  └ ...
  |  ├ extension.js
  |  ├ index.js
  |  └ package.json
